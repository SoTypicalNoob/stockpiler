#+TITLE: Stockpiler (shelf-life tracker)
Have you ever tried to buy some fancy stuff for cooking or baking and you forgot about it? Then, the next thing you realized was that it expired a long time ago. Yep, I know that feeling and I had enough. My plan to build a basic database for my stored food and to interact with this database via a web service.
*Planned features:*
+ The database and the webservice are planned to be deployed on a Raspberry Pi (3 or 4)
+ Webservice will be written in Python using Flask
+ Expiring date will be check automatically every midnight and the following items will be collected to a 'dashboard':
  * Already expired
  * Will be expired within a week
+ Amount of the items will be checked automatically every midnight and those items that are categorized as important will be collected to the 'dashboard'
